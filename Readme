To embed a framework that's the output of a sibling project within the same Xcode workspace:

1. Build HelloFramework for iOS, _not_ for simulator
2. Go to Project Navigator > HelloApp > Target > Build Phases
3. Add HelloFramework to the Link Binary With Libraries phase
4. Back in Project Navigator, the linked framework will appear under HelloApp, select it
5. Open the utilities pane (cmd+opt+0)
6. Change the Location of HelloFramework to "Relative to Build Products"
7. Back in Build Phases for HarpApp, Create an additional Copy Files phase
8. Set the Destination to "Frameworks"
9. Add the HelloFramework that's nested under HelloApp

This setup prevents the runtime error:

dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/HelloFramework.framework/HelloFramework
Referenced from: /var/containers/Bundle/Application/<snip>/HelloApp.app/HelloApp
Reason: image not found

And:

dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/HelloFramework.framework/HelloFramework
Referenced from: /var/containers/Bundle/Application/<snip>/HelloApp.app/HelloApp
Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:
/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/<snip>/HelloApp.app/Frameworks/HelloFramework.framework/HelloFramework: mach-o, but wrong architecture

And the compile time error:
